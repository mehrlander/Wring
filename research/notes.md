# Research Notes

> A working notebook for connecting findings, tracking decisions, and capturing thoughts as you distill the research.

## Connections Between Questions

[Note how findings from different questions relate or inform each other]

## Open Decisions

[Track unresolved architectural choices and what would help resolve them]

## Things to Try

[Experiments, prototypes, or validation approaches suggested by the research]

## Tensions & Trade-offs

[Where different findings or approaches conflict - what are we optimizing for?]

*Keep this organic and chronological. Add to it as you work through the distillations.*
