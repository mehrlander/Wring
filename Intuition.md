Template Discovery
The Problem
Text often contains internally repeated structures (e.g., log entries, data lists, code blocks). We want to programmatically identify these implicit templates.
First Observations
 * Structure: A template is composed of an ordered sequence of literals interleaved with variables that represent an arbitrary string.
 * Recurrence: Any literal in a template must occur at least twice in the document, and any template must have at least one literal.
 * Frequency: A meaningful template occurs two or more times. Each occurrence is an instance of the template.
 * Binary Matching: A template is defined such that a given substring either matches it or does not.
 * Zero-Parameter Case: A literal recurrence of a substring establishes a zero-parameter template.
 * Parameterized Case: Any parameterized template must be composed of at least two recurring substrings (to frame the variable).
 * Nesting: A template may include another template within it.
 * Partial Overlap: If a template partially includes another, substitution of one would break the other.
 * Variable Constraints: A variable represents an arbitrary string, though it may optionally be constrained to match a specific pattern.
